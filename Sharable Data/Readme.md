Title of Dataset
Supplementary Materials associated with Grabowski (in review) - Blouch: Bayesian Linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Models for Comparative Hypotheses

These datasets are used in the empirical example from Grabowski (in review). They are taken from Tsuboi et al. (in revision), who collected a dataset on Cervidae antler size and body size and generated a new Cervidae phylogeny. This dataset was supplemented with data on Cervidae breeding group size from Plard et al. (2011) and Clutton-Brock et al. (1980).

Description of the data and file structure
1. Blouch_empirical_dataset.xlsx Data includes Microsoft Excel file with complete empirical example data associated with Grabowski (in review). This is broken down into Cervidae species information for natural logged antler volume (log_ant_vol), natural logged posterior skull length (log_psl), standard deviation of antler volume (log_ant_vol_sd), standard deviation of posterior skull length (log_psl_sd), estimated variance of logged posterior skull length (log_psl_var_est), estimated variance of logged antler volume (log_vol_var_est), and breeding group size data following the same format as Plard et al. (2011) (BGS).

2. cervidae_renamed.tre - phylogeny in NEXUS format matching empirical example data.
