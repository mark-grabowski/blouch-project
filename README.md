# BLOUCH
Bayesian Linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models for Comparative Hypotheses (BLOUCH) fits adaptive models of continuous trait evolution in a Bayesian framework based on categorical or continuous predictors, and incorporates measurement error. Blouch can also make phylogenetically informed predictions of known or unknown traits from any clade, given a dataset of comparative measurements and a phylogeny including the taxa of interest.
